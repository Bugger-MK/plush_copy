        Hey there plushie,  
        
        I just want to take a moment to say how much I appreciate you and everything you bring to the world. Life, as we both know, isn’t always easy. It’s full of twists and turns, highs and lows, and moments that feel like they might break us. But it’s also full of wonders—those little sparks of joy and beauty that remind us why we keep going.  
        
        You’ve been through so much, and yet here you are, standing strong, continuing to push forward. That’s something not everyone can do, and I hope you take a moment to be proud of yourself for that. You’ve proven that even in the face of hardship, there’s resilience and grace in you. And I hope you remember that strength whenever you’re feeling lost or overwhelmed.  
        
        But as much as life can be tough, it’s also a world filled with so much good. There’s laughter waiting to be shared, places waiting to be explored, people waiting to meet you who will add to your story in unexpected and beautiful ways. I hope you never lose sight of that—that the world, despite its challenges, has so much to offer you.  
        
        Getting to know you has been a privilege. You’ve let me see layers of who you are—the depth, the light, the struggles, and the triumphs. It’s been an incredible journey to learn about you, to witness your heart, your thoughts, and your dreams. And I want you to know how much I value that. You’ve let me into your world, and I don’t take that for granted.  
        
        As you keep moving forward, I just want you to know that I’m rooting for you every step of the way. I hope you find your path, whatever that looks like for you. I hope you discover all the beauty that life has in store and that you hold on to the good even when things feel heavy.  
        
        You’ve got so much ahead of you—so many possibilities, so much potential. And I’m grateful to have had this time to be a small part of your journey, to see the amazing person you are and all that you’re becoming.  
        
        So, here’s to you. To your strength, your spirit, and your future. May you find your way, and may it lead to all the happiness and fulfillment you deserve.  
        
        Take care of yourself, and never stop believing in the wonder of what’s ahead.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        With all my best wishes,  
        Squishy
